<P>This developer manual generally describes important rules for
installing Unix-like application to Q4OS operating system, alongside
clarifies essential install steps and also help you to understand
Q4OS basics and design. 
</P>
<P>Q4OS is desktop operating system designed to offer compact and
clean user interface, simple accessories and to serve stable
foundation for running complex third-party applications. Since Q4OS
is a Debian/Linux based OS, it uses "Apt" package
management system and related tools to maintain system health and
clean. 
</P>
<P>We advise you to use QT libraries API to program your
applications. If Application requires some library or other software,
which is not part of base Q4OS installation, the easiest way is pick
it and install as a system shared from official Q4OS repository.
Another way is to add library directly into your setup package,
decreasing dependency on third-party software. It is possible to run
Linux executables without restriction or modification.<!-- If you are
looking for specific example, please read document <A HREF="dqa008.html">Step-by-step
to create new Q4OS Application</A>.--></P>

<UL>
	<LI><P>Any Application file may not affect other system files or
	directory structure !</P>
	<LI><P>Install Applications using "Apt" package management
	system. Two exceptions are enabled, see "simple setup mode"
	and "user setup mode" bellow.</P>
	<LI><P>All Application files are located in "/program_files/appname"
	directory, some rare exceptions are specified in this document.</P>
	<LI><P>System menu entries in
	"/usr/share/apps/q4os_system/q4os_menus_applications_merged/".</P>
	<LI><P>System menu links in

	<LI><P>Using "/tmp/" for temporary operations is
	recommended.</P>
	<LI><P>Placing file to other than specified location is allowed only
	in absolutely necessary cases, such files must be controlled via
	"Apt" packaging system.</P>
	<LI><P>Q4OS allows you to install application bypassing "Apt"
	system using "simple setup mode", installer in this mode
	must absolutely strictly pass criteria quoted <A HREF="#s-link03.2">here</A>.</P>
	<LI><P>It is possible to install user specific application in "user
	setup mode", installer in this mode must pass criteria quoted

<P><A NAME="s-link03"></A><FONT SIZE=4><B>3. Installer</B></FONT></P>
<P>Install job should be automated by user comfortable installer to
let user to answer questions, take some more installation steps like
environment checks, pre/post-install actions, another optional steps
and finally install the software. Packages can be packed together and
joined to installer creating single self-extracting executable.<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><A NAME="s-link03.1"></A><B>3.1. Standard setup using Apt</B></P>
<P>The preferred way to distribute your application is to create Apt
"*.deb" packages (or single package) installable using
"apt" or "dpkg" commands, which are part of
basic system installation. If Application requires some external
library, which is included in official Q4OS repository, you can set
it as dependency and installer automatically takes care about proper
setup. Installer can install/remove packages from official
repositories standard "Apt" way using command-line tools as
"dpkg" or "apt", any administrative
operations need to be executed via "sudo" command. Using
"Apt" capabilities and advanced functions, significantly
make easier developing and distributing your software. For detailed
resource on "Apt" package management system look at
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy</A>.</P>
<P>You can take and modify simple installer skeleton from "Q4OS
Development Pack" software now, we plan to release official Q4OS
installer in the future.</P>
<P>Advantages of using "Apt" package management system:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>control over any Application file</P>
	<LI><P>take care about installation of dependent software</P>
	<LI><P>close integration to system, keeping it clean</P>
	<LI><P>watch dependencies, avoid package conflicts</P>
	<LI><P>easy uninstall process</P>
	<LI><P>easy update mechanism</P>
	<LI><P>possibility to create your own Internet repository</P>
	<LI><P>possibility to order your app into Q4OS software centre</P>
</UL>
<P>Notes about installer actions:</P>
<P>Application installer has to process at minimum the following
operations:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Create "program_files/appname" directory.</P>
	<LI><P>Copy application files and directory structure into
	"program_files/appname".</P>
	<LI><P>Create menu and desktop entries.</P>
	<LI><P>Register application to the system.</P>
</UL>
<P>Optional operations:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Create configuration files.</P>
	<LI><P>Adding some system users and groups.</P>
	<LI><P>Other operations.</P>
</UL>
<P>Important restrictions !</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Application may not affect any Q4OS system files and
	structure.</P>
	<LI><P>All files should be installed into permitted folders only.<BR><BR><BR>
	</P>
</UL>
<P><A NAME="s-link03.2"></A><B>3.2. Simple setup mode</B></P>
<P>Q4OS allows installer to only copy application files into
"/program_files/appname" tree without packaging and
installing with "Apt", but you loose some noted advantages
in this case. However the basic rules must be kept:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>All files belonging to application must be located in
	"program_files/appname" and/or user's
	"$HOME/.program_files/appname" directory.</P>
	<LI><P>Register application into the system using
	"/usr/share/apps/q4os_system/q4_regs/appname.qrg" file.</P>
	<LI><P>Menu entries located in "$HOME/.q4data/applnk/Programs"
	directory.</P>
	<LI><P>Desktop icons located in "$HOME/Desktop".</P>
	<LI><P>Other application files can be stored somewhere in user's
	"$HOME/" directory structure.</P>
	<LI><P>Any other file locations and other exceptions are strictly
	forbidden in "simple setup mode".<BR><BR><BR>
	</P>
</UL>
<P><A NAME="s-link03.3"></A><B>3.3. User setup mode</B></P>
<P>Non-privileged users will use this mode for installations, all
Application files are located strictly in user's "$HOME/"
directory structure. It is recommended to use
"$HOME/.program_files/appname" folder as much as possible.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="s-link04"></A><FONT SIZE=4><B>4. Directory tree</B></FONT></P>
<P>According to basic Q4OS rules, any file (executables, libraries,
data, ...) belonging to an application has to be located in
application specific folder "/program_files/appname" with
rare exceptions (menu and desktop entries, configuration) all
described in this document. "/program_files" folder is
intended to be independent on operating system files and structure.</P>
<P>One necessary step for installer is to create folder
"/program_files/appname" and copy all application data into
it. Subtree structure is optional, for example properly ported Unix
applications will contain standard subdirectories like "bin,
share, var, etc, ..."

entry can be global (for all users) or user specific. Important
system directories intended to write to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Menu entries -
	global:<BR>"/usr/share/apps/q4os_system/q4os_menus_applications_merged/"<BR>Directory

	<LI><P>Menu entries -
	user:<BR>"$HOME/.q4data/applnk/Programs"<BR>Directory
	contains user menu items, organized into real subdirectory
	structure. Any directory can contain subdirectory (submenu) or
	"*.desktop" file (menu item). Users are allowed to add,
	remove or change menu items modifying this directory structure and

"$HOME/.appname/".</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="s-link08"></A><FONT SIZE=4><B>8. Registration</B></FONT></P>
<P>Applications have to be registered by describing "appname.qrg"
file in "/usr/share/apps/q4os_system/q4_regs/q4apps" directory. Installer create new file
"/usr/share/apps/q4os_system/q4_regs/appname.qrg" copying skeleton file
"app.qrg.template" and substitute all fields
properly. This step is important to maintain proper information about
your application, *.qrg file is a simple, but important interface
between your application and Q4OS.</P>

<P><A NAME="s-link09"></A><FONT SIZE=4><B>9. Internet repository</B></FONT></P>
<P>You can have your own Internet repository for easy application
updates or to order your app in the Q4OS software centre. To learn how
create your own GPG signed Internet software repository start here

<HR>
<P><A NAME="s-link10"></A><FONT SIZE=4><B>10. Update mechanism</B></FONT></P>
<P>There is no recommended way how to solve this quite complicated
task. You can use custom software repository and package management
system to simplify developer's life. If you need some specific
functions, you have to code custom updater. Doing any update action,
it is important to ensure keeping Apt package system in clean
consistent state.</P>

<HR>
<P><A NAME="s-link11"></A><FONT SIZE=4><B>11. Porting existing
applications</B></FONT></P>
<P>Q4OS handles typical Unix filesystem structure, any native Linux
executable can be run without modification, so porting Unix
applications is fairly easy. The easiest, but not clean way would be
simply run "make install", however you have to take care
about Q4OS installation rules above. 
</P>
<P>At minimal, you should modify Makefile to add menu and desktop
entries for Q4OS and take care of registration to the system.
Locating installed files in "program_files/appname" folder
is strongly recommended, although not necessary. Installing with user
comfortable <A HREF="#s-link03">installer</A> improve user's comfort
and make distribution of your application easier.</P>

<HR>
<P><A NAME="s-link12"></A><FONT SIZE=4><B>12. Windows applications</B></FONT></P>
<P>It is possible to run Windows applications within Q4OS using <A HREF="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</A>
compatibility layer. There is Wine installer available at Q4OS website, development utilities are
installable from basic Q4OS repositories. Developers can use great
Wine debug tools and <A HREF="http://wiki.winehq.org/Winelib">WineLib</A>
to adapt even to compile Windows applications for Q4OS. See <A HREF="http://www.winehq.org/docs/winedev-guide/index">Wine
Developer's Guide</A>, detailed resource for development with Wine.
At the moment we are working at Wine optimization and close
integration into the Q4OS system.</P>
