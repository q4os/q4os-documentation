    <b>How to recover/restore forgotten/lost password(without booting to
      a Live USB)</b><br>
    <br>
    <div align="justify">In the unfortunate event that you somehow have
      lost/forgotten your Q4OS username's password, that is, the
      password you use to <b>log in </b>to your system as well as
      execute <b>sudo</b> commands in the terminal, here's a method you
      can use to restore/recover it without having to download a new
      .iso(in case you don't have it at hand at the moment), create a
      Live media, change your pc's BIOS settings so it boots the USB
      stick, mount partitions<b> </b>and chroot, a process that can be
      quite tedious for such a simple task, instead, you just need to
      boot to your Q4OS installation, edit <b>grub </b>and add a
      single line, type in a few (3) easy commands, reboot and log in
      with your new password. For that purpose, just follow the
      following instructions:&nbsp; <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    1. Turn on your pc, and when Q4OS starts booting press the <b>shift
      key</b>, so you can access the grub console<br>

    <br>
    2. You may have noticed the <b>highlighted line </b>in the img
    above, well do as it says and press <b>e</b> to edit boot options,
    you should see this<br>

    <br>
    3. Scroll down using the arrows keys, and right after where it reads
    <b>status=1</b> add the following <b>rw init=/bin/bash</b> so it
    looks like this<br>

      alt="Add new parameter rw init=/bin/bash" width="905" height="489"><br>
    <br>
    4. Hit <b>Ctrl + x</b> to save the changes and boot to a command
    line console. Now, type <b>passwd</b> followed by your username,
    and press <b>Enter</b>, for example, I did <b>passwd tolkem</b>.
    You'll be prompted to type in, and confirm your new password, do so.
    Once the password has been updated/restored successfully, type in <b>sync</b>
    and press <b>Enter</b>, then type in <b>reboot -f</b>, and press <b>Enter</b>
    again.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    At this point, Q4OS should start normally, and you should be able to
    log in with your new password in TDM, like I did<br>

    <br>
    Well, that's it. Pretty easy, isn't it? Now you know how to
    recover/restore your lost/forgotten password without having to boot
    to a Live USB, mount partitions, chroot and all that. <span

    <br>
    <b>NOTE:</b> In step 3, I said "Scroll down using the arrows keys,
    and right after where it reads <b>status=1</b>, add the following <b>rw
      init=/bin/bash</b>" however, you may or may not have noticed that
    in the next img in <b>step 4</b> that line is actually right after
    <b>log_color=0</b>, thing is, that key for "<b>=</b>" doesn't work
    in my keyboard if using an English layout, like in <b>grub</b>. So
    I had to delete the <b>status=1</b> line, and reuse the "<b>=</b>"
    symbol, but I think it should still work by just adding the line
    right after. I just wanted to mention that, so you don't get
    confused. <span class="moz-smiley-s1"><span>:-)</span></span><br>
